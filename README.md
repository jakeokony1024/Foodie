## What is Foodie?
Foodie is something that is something.
## Environment Setup



## Running the Project
In the project directory, run:
## `npm i --save`
## `npm start`
if only seeing white screen, look at src/App.js file :rofl:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Inspiration
 review this [app](https://thecookbookapp.com/)

 review [webpage](https://www.mygreatrecipes.com/) also has an app

## Current Issues

## Things To Do

connect recipe scraper tool, saves recipes to book

## Development Notes
###User
+ searchable
+ has profile / everything user has posted
+ feed of recent activity from friends 
+ has a list of friends
+ Each user has recipe book with public and private recipes

###Post 
+ can be video, photo with title, recipe
+ recipes posted display title and type
+ searchable

###recipes
+ searchable
+ each recipe has photo assigned to it (can be multiple)
+ each recipe can be marked private or public
+ public recipes are stored in a book under a user's account
+ access to private recipes is determined by the user on a case by case, or large scale basis (select multiple recipes to give access to).
+ Private recipe titles are public, ingredients and instructions are blurred. access can be requested by a user's friend.
+ recipes can be converted to and from metric / imperial
+ yields adjust ingredient amounts
+ substitute ingredients can be suggested after recipe creation / setting turned on


## Api Documentation

## Dependencies

## Deployment



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
